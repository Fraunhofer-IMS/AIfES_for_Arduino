 * \brief Base \link ailayer layer \endlink implementation of the Reshape layer
 *
 * This is an "abstract" data-type independent implementation. To use the layer use one of the provided
 * implementations for a specific hardware and data-type (for example from ailayer_reshape_default.h) or set
 * the required math functions on your own.
 *
 * The Reshape layer (also used as Flatten layer) is used to reshape a tensor during the forward pass
 * without changing any data. This can be useful for example to connect a \link ailayer_dense.h Dense layer \endlink
 * to a convolutional layer by using the Flatten layer.
 *
 * The results of the forward pass of this layer are written to the result tensor of the base ailayer_t struct.
